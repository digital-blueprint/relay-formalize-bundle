when one creator tries to post more submissions to a form than are allowed for the form
- Add submission attribute date last modified, which is set to date created on creation and then set to the current 
time on every update

## v0.4.23

- Add filter `whereMayReadSubmissions` to GET form collection request, which limits the form results to 
those that the user either has read (all) form submissions permissions for, or has submissions that they may read
(e.g. their own submissions)

## v0.4.22

- Create a command that creates and sets up the Demo Form
- Add granted actions to Submission API output
- Add filters:
  - `whereReadFormSubmissionsGranted`: only return forms where the set of allowed actions contains `read_submissions`,
  i.e. the current user is allowed to read all submissions of
  - `whereContainsSubmissionsMayRead`: only return forms that contain at least one submission that the current
  user has a submission-level read permission for. NOTE: forms the current user has a `read_submissions` permission for
  are only returned if they contain at least one submission that the current user has created or was granted read access to.
- Add Form.allowedActionsWhenSubmitted defining the maximum set of allowed actions once the submission is in
 submitted state, regardless of the grants the user may have for the submission (NOTE: it limits the set of 
allowed actions and does not add to it)
- Rename Form.submissionLevelAuthorization to Form.grantBasedSubmissionAuthorization:
    - If true, authorization decisions are based on grants (managed by the authorization bundle).
      When new submissions are registered, the creator is issued a manage grant and may thus issue grants for the submission to other user.
    - If false (-> created-based submission authorization), authorization decisions or based on the creatorId of the submission.
- Add submissionState to the submission which allows to save drafts before actually submitting. Current submissions states:
  - Draft: Drafts are only visible to users with a read permissions to the submission itself, users with
  read submissions permissions for the form don't see them
  - Submitted: Submitted submissions are visible to users with a read submissions permissions for the form.
  Users with read permissions for the submission itself have s subset of the permissions listed in
  Form.allowedActionsWhenSubmitted
- Add allowedSubmissionStates to the form to allow the specification whether draft submissions are allowed for a form

## v0.4.7

submissions that the current user is authorized to read (all submissions of forms where they have a 'read_submissions' grant for and
single submissions that they are authorized to read, e.g. that they have posted). The parameter 'formIdentifier' is now optional and
can be considered as filter to list of submissions, returning only the submissions of the specified form that current user is
authorized to read (NOTE: it does neither throw 404 'not found' nor 403 'forbidden')

## v0.4.4

- Add submission level authorization as a new form attribute
- Enable cascade delete for form submissions on form deletion
- Add a new parameter 'getAll' to the GET submission collection operation. If specified, all form submissions are returned.
Otherwise, only the form submissions the logged-in user is granted to read are returned (requires submission level authorization
to be enabled in the form)
